#   - with the name provided as the second argument, or default 'pkg_ros2_opencv'
#   - This package has the dependencies needed to work with OpenCV in ROS2, 
#     and to create a ROS2 node that can subscribe to image topics and process them with OpenCV.

# It can also create a ROS2 project if the workspace name is an absolute path
