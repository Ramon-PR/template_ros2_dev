# Changes with respect to the original template:
# - ROS2 is installed in the system, so we need to use the system python packages 
#   in the uv virtual environment, which is needed to use ROS2 python packages.
# - uv should not use the latest python version, so we first check the python version
#   and init the uv project with that version. 
# - uv venv --system-site-packages is first run to allow .venv to see the system python packages
# - When installing nbdev, it will install matplotlib-inline 0.2.1 (its latest version),
#   however, the latest version of matplotlib-inline is not compatible with the system Matplotlib that 
#   is required by ROS2.
# - We create a constraints.txt file with the compatible version of matplotlib-inline, 
#   which is the only package that is incompatible with the system python packages.
# - We use the --constraint option of uv add to install nbdev with the compatible versions
# - It seems that there is no automatic way to know that matplotlib-inline 0.2.1
#   is incompatible with the system Matplotlib, so we need to manually add it to the constraints.txt file.
